## 🚦 Quick Start Guide

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MY_TRADING_BOT.git
cd MY_TRADING_BOT

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **1. Market Analysis Dashboard**
Launch the interactive stock analysis tool:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

**Features:**
- Real-time stock data visualisation
- Technical analysis with customisable indicators
- Historical performance metrics and statistics
- Interactive date range filtering
- Export capabilities for further analysis

### **2. Strategy Backtesting**
Run comprehensive backtesting on historical data:
```python
# Example: Backtest with default strategy
python main.py

# The system will automatically:
# 1. Load historical market data
# 2. Apply trading strategy logic
# 3. Calculate performance metrics
# 4. Generate detailed reports
```

### **3. Live Trading (Paper Mode)**
Deploy strategies in paper trading environment:
```python
# Configure in main.py
broker_config = {
    'api_key': 'YOUR_ALPACA_API_KEY',
    'secret_key': 'YOUR_ALPACA_SECRET',
    'base_url': 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'  # Paper trading
}

bot = UltraAITradingBot(
    symbols=["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"], 
    live_trading=True, 
    broker_config=broker_config
)

bot.start_live_trading(poll_interval=60)
```

### **4. Performance Dashboard**
Monitor bot performance in real-time:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## 📈 Strategy Implementation

### **Technical Analysis Framework**
Our signal generation system combines multiple proven strategies:

**Momentum Strategies:**
- RSI-based mean reversion
- MACD trend following
- Bollinger Band breakouts

**Confluence Scoring:**
- Multi-indicator signal validation
- Strength-weighted position sizing
- Risk-adjusted entry and exit points

**Example Strategy Configuration:**
```python
strategy_config = {
    'rsi_period': 14,
    'rsi_oversold': 30,
    'rsi_overbought': 70,
    'macd_fast': 12,
    'macd_slow': 26,
    'macd_signal': 9,
    'bb_period': 20,
    'bb_std': 2
}
```

## 🎯 Risk Management System

### **Position Sizing Algorithm**
```python
# Dynamic position sizing based on:
# - Portfolio volatility
# - Individual stock volatility  
# - Maximum drawdown limits
# - Kelly Criterion optimisation

position_size = calculate_position_size(
    account_equity=portfolio_value,
    risk_per_trade=0.02,  # 2% risk per trade
    volatility=stock_volatility,
    stop_loss_distance=stop_loss_pct
)
```

### **Risk Controls**
- **Maximum Portfolio Exposure**: 95% of capital
- **Per-Trade Risk Limit**: Configurable (default: 2%)
